<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, we will guide you in setting up an Active Directory Home Lab Environment using Oracle Virtual Box. The process of configuring and running this lab is designed to enhance your comprehension of Active Directory and Windows networking. It is strongly recommended to go through the steps multiple times, seek clarification on any unclear aspects, and eventually attempt to build it independently without relying on instructions. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance!
